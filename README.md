# About
This is a small webapp to determine who should pay who when splitting a total cost between roommates.

It is currently deployed to Heroku [here](https://utilities-balancer.herokuapp.com/)

This app uses HTML5 for DOM elements and styles them with CSS (Duh). The business logic is implemented with Angular4. A single purpose Node.js server is used to serve the build version.

# Utilites

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.2.

# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
